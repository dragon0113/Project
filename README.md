This report correspond to the project for the class Stat597A Bioinformatics for High Throuhput Experiments during the Spring semester in 2014. The project is a collaboration between Hannier Pulido (HP) & Yong Jung (YJ)  

The following is the workflow of the data analysis and the person responsible for each step:  

1) Access to CEL files **(HP)**  
2) Quality Assessment on raw data **(HP)**   
    * RNA degradation plots
    * Boxplots
    * Density plots
3) Preprocess data **(HP)**    
    * Background correction and normalization
    * Filtering absent genes
    * Remove outliers and unidentified groups

4) Preliminary analysis **(YJ)**  
    * K-means clustering

5) Quality assessment of filtered data **(HP)**    
    *Boxplots
    *Density plots
    *MVA plots

6) Exploratory analysis  **(HP)**  
    *HCA
    *PCA

7) Random Forest **(HP)**  

8) Variable selection **(HP)**  

9) Visualization of results **(HP)**  

10) Functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology  **(YJ)**  

11) Literature review using the GO terms **(YJ & HP)**
