This report correspond to the project for the class Stat597A Bioinformatics for High Throuhput Experiments during the Spring semester in 2014. The project is a collaboration between Yong Jung (YJ) & Hannier Pulido (HP).

The following is the workflow of the data analysis and the person responsible for each step:  

1) Access to CEL files **(YJ & HP)**

2) Quality Assessment on raw data **(HP)**   
    * RNA degradation plots  
    * Boxplots  
    * Density plots  

3) Preprocess data **(YJ & HP)**    
    * Background correction and normalization  
    * Filtering absent genes  
    * Remove outliers and unidentified groups  

4) Preliminary analysis **(YJ)**  
    * K-means clustering  

5) Quality assessment of filtered data **(HP)**    
    * Boxplots  
    * Density plots  
    * MVA plots  

6) Exploratory analysis  **(HP)**  
    * K-means clustering  
    * HCA    
    * PCA  

7) Random Forest for feature selection **(HP)**  

8) Visualization of results **(YJ & HP)**  

9) Functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology  **(YJ)**  

10) Literature review using the GO terms **(YJ & HP)**
